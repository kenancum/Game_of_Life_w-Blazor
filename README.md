# Game of Life
This project is one of my University Projects. It simulates Known Mathematician Conway's Game of Life theorem. The technology I used in this project is Blazor.


## Game of Life Explanation
The Game of Life is not your typical computer game. It is a cellular automaton, and was invented by Cambridge mathematician John Conway. This game became widely known when it was mentioned in an article published by Scientific American in 1970. It consists of a grid of cells which, based on a few mathematical rules, can live, die or multiply. Depending on the initial conditions, the cells form various patterns throughout the course of the game.

### Rules
For a space that is populated:
1. Each cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by solitude. 
2. Each cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
3. Each cell with two or three neighbors survives.

For a space that is empty or unpopulated:
1. Each cell with three neighbors becomes populated.
